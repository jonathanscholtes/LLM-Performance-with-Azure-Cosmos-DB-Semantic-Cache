# Python FastAPI Project with LangChain for RAG

## Overview
This Python FastAPI project integrates LangChain for implementing the RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) pattern, leveraging a CosmosDB vector store for text retrieval and an Azure Storage Account for image retrieval. Azure Cosmos DB Semantic Cache is leveraged to improve performance of common questions.

## Features
- Utilizes FastAPI for building a high-performance web API.
- Integrates LangChain for implementing the RAG pattern, enabling advanced natural language processing tasks.
- Utilizes CosmosDB vector store for efficient text retrieval based on semantic similarity.
- Retrieves images from an Azure Storage Account associated with the retrieved text.

## Requirements
- Python environment with FastAPI, LangChain, and Azure SDK installed.
- Access to Azure subscription for deploying CosmosDB and Azure Storage Account.
- Basic knowledge of FastAPI, LangChain, CosmosDB, and Azure Storage concepts.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up CosmosDB for MongoDB VCore Vector Store and Azure Storage Account in your Azure subscription.
3. Create **.env** file and populate:
- OPENAI_API_KEY=''
- MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING=''
- AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=''
- AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER="images"
4. Create pythonn env: 
```
python -m venv venv
```
5. Install Requirements:
```
venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run the FastAPI server:
```
python main.py
```

# Project Description: Loading Documents into Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore Vector Store

## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the process of loading documents into a Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore Vector Store using LangChain Loaders, while also loading images into an Azure Storage Account. 

## Features
- Integration of LangChain Loaders for seamless document loading into Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore Vector Store.
- Utilization of Azure Storage Account for efficient storage and retrieval of images associated with the documents.
- Demonstrates how to set up and configure the environment for document and image loading tasks.

## Requirements
- Azure subscription for deploying Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore and Azure Storage Account.
- Python environment with LangChain and Azure SDK installed.
- Basic knowledge of MongoDB, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Storage concepts.

## Usage
1. Set up Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore and Azure Storage Account in your Azure subscription.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Create **.env** file and populate:
- OPENAI_API_KEY=''
